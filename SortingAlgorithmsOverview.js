// What is sorting?
// The process of rearranging the items in a collection so that the items are in some kind of order

// Examples:
// Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
// Sorting names alphabetically
// Sorting movies based on release year
// Sorting movies based on revenue

function sort(arr) {
  return arr;
}

sort([23, 45, 6, 12, 13]); // [6,12,13,23]

// Why learn sorting?
// Very common in coding
// Every sorting algorithm has different pros or cons, they work better in different scenarios (different kinds of data)
// We also want to understand how built in sort methods work, so we know when we should use them over another!
// Classic interview problems!

// Elementary sorting algorithms //
// Bubble Sort //
// Selection Sort //
// Insertion Sort //

// These sorting methods are not common but are a good introduction to sorting.
